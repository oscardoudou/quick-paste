# Quick Paste
#### Manage you frequently used item for easy access. 
## Inspiration
Initially it is just a simple tool to facilate my job application filling process. When I do job hunting, my mac was slow. Opening too many app(Adobe Reader, MS Word and too much safari chrome tab) significantly slow my mac. Also copy paste repeatedly is tedious. So I came to the idea to store frequently copied item in menu bar.  

## Current Phase
Support local file and folder

Support custom url scheme, run `open "readlog://textwanttosend"`in terminal would copy the text to menu. 

The initial purpose resume parsing, menu would look good only in this [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8r6wm7d8t45pmsc/2019_Resume_Yichi_Zhang.pdf?dl=0) format. 
## To Do
- [x] key binding, menu seperator 
- [x] support file
- [ ] fix custom url scheme crash
- [ ] clean item representation
- [ ] restrict menu size
- [ ] duplicate check
- [ ] file icon 

 A lot to do.
